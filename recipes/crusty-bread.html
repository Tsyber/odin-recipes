    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3.25 cups water, lukewarm, about 100° F.</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoon dry active yeast</li>
        <li>6.5 cups flour, bread flour if you have it.</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoon kosher salt, (May use less if desired.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and yeast and stir until the yeast is dissolved. Add flour and salt and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rise for 2 hours at room temperature, covered with a kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Apply a light dusting of flour over the dough and divide it in half and shape into 2 loaves, rounding the top. If you only want to make one loaf of bread at this time, store the unused dough in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 2 weeks until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Place the unbaked loaf(s) on pizza peel that is lightly dusted with cornmeal. Apply light dusting of flour over top and cut three slashes into top of dough, using a searrated knife. Cover dough with kitchen towel and allow to rest for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450° F with baking stone on the center rack. When bread is ready to go in the oven, slide the dough off pizza peel onto hot stone. Place 1 cup hot water into oven broiler (or other oven safe pan), on bottom wrack of oven. Quickly close oven door to created a steam bath within the oven. This will help produce a crisp outer crust.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes and allow to cool slightly before slicing. Enjoy!</li>
