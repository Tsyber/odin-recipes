    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hibachi Fried Rice (Japanese Fried Rice) is a rice stir fry where cooked rice is sauteed in a wok or a large skillet with butter, soy sauce, and other ingredients. It is like classic fried rice, plus the savory flavor from lots of butter.
    The Japanese word Hibachi means “fire bowl.” It is also called Teppanyaki-style cooking. Traditionally, this cooking style refers to an open-top ceramic bowl containing burning charcoal for heating purposes.
    These days, electric barbecues are used instead of an open fire with a large griddle or wok on top. When we are preparing it at home, all you need is a large wok or a large flat-bottomed pan.
    When made at home, this fried rice comes together in no time and at a fraction of the cost. It tastes just like the fried rice at a Hibachi restaurant and requires some essential ingredients primarily available in the pantry.
    This is also a great recipe to use up your leftover rice. This dish turns out better when made with one-day-old cold rice. So, whenever I have leftover rice, I quickly whip up this Hibachi-style fried Rice.
    Serve it for a quick weekday meal or pack it for school or office lunchboxes.
